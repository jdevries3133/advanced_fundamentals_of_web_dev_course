# Curriculum Overview

**Title:** Advanced Fundamentals of Web Development

**Duration:** 18 weeks

This course leads students through a pragmatic deep dive into the fundamental
building blocks of the web. We forgo frameworks and abstractions so that we can
get deep into the heart of what makes the web tick. We start with low-level
labs that will stretch understanding of what the HTTP protocol is, and what it
can do.

This highly interactive course is built to develop first-principles thinking on
web technologies, By developing a strong understanding of the foundation upon
which we build web applications, you will gain an intuitive understanding of
how high-level and abstract technologies like React, GraphQL, tRPC, and Next.js
work. More importantly, you will understand why we reach for these high-level
niceties, having had the experience of working without these tools. Not only
that, while the JavaScript framework de jour changes every few years, the
knowledge you glean from this course will be evergreen.

By the end of the course, you will be able to build a beautiful, complex,
interactive full-stack web application using nothing but vanilla client-side
JavaScript, Express, and a SQL database. You will build this application
creatively from scratch! There will be none of the typical tutorial
anti-patterns of "just copy this 1000 line blob of goo and go build this other
part over there"

# Technologies Taught

- HTTP protocol
- JavaScript
- Express
- HTML & CSS
- SQL
- JSON & fetch

# Concepts Taught

- creating server-rendered dynamic web applications
- creating client-side-javascript-driven web applications
- data modeling in an RDBMS
- RESTful JSON API design patterns

# Prerequisites

- Basic JavaScript (or similar) competency
  - variables
  - boolean expressions
  - conditional control flow (`if` / `if else` / `else`, `switch` statements)
  - functions
  - promises & `async` / `await`
- Knowledge of HTML and CSS
  - this is a bit of a soft requirement, if you don't have it, the course won't
    cover it, and your websites will look quite ugly. The course will focus on
    the logical behavior of the web pages more than the appearance, so you'll
    have to bring this knowledge with you if you want your work to look
    visually appealing
  - that being said, you won't be 100% hung out to dry here, but definitely
    expect some ugly duckling websites if you have zero prior knowledge, and
    that's OK! If it works, it works :)
